        content to its frame, which generally (but not necessarily) coincides with that of the
        application’s main window. A scroll view tracks the movements of fingers and adjusts the
        origin accordingly. The view that is showing its content “through” the scroll view draws
        that portion of itself based on the new origin, which is pinned to an offset in the content
        view.</string>
