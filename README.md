Android Application Repo for:
  Tink,
  Seeker,
  Travel App

**Tink**: a way to connect college students to job opportunities on campus and summer internships. Each user will have a profile that features their resume, what classes they have taken, and what kind of job they are looking for. 

**Seeker**: an app that organizes the lost and found system on closed campuses. Users will be able to make posts about items they have lost, and "Seekers", once they find the correct lost item and return it to the owner, will earn "karma".

**Travel App**: going somewhere? Users can enter a vacation/travel destination along with the duration of their stay, and the app will propose a travel plan complete with sightseeing locations, places to eat, etc. Be able to see where your Facebook friends have checked in, budget your stay (e.g. how much to spend per day), rate the places you have visited, and add photos from your trip.
