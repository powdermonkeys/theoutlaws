Android Application Repo for:
  Tink,
  Seeker,
  Travel App

**Tink**: a way to connect college students to job opportunities on campus and summer internships. Each user will have a profile that features their resume, what classes they have taken, and what kind of job they are looking for. At career fairs, recruiters can scan your Tink QR code to get your resume. Students can even possibly apply to jobs or do interviews through the app using video calls, etc. Look for jobs in your radius through the a location-based job list. Connect to a tutor or a mentor/mentee through the app's built-in social network.

**Seeker**: an app that organizes the lost and found system on closed campuses. Users will be able to make posts about items they have lost, and "Seekers", once they find the correct lost item and return it to the owner, will earn "karma" or some sort of point. Take a picture from within the app and upload it immediately. If you've lost something, give a description and sort by filters to find it, or get notified once your item is found, or use geofencing and location data to estimate where you were when you lost it. A leaderboard will exist to display the top seekers on each campus.

**Travel App**: going somewhere? Users can enter a vacation/travel destination along with the duration of their stay, and the app will propose a travel plan complete with sightseeing locations, places to eat, etc. Be able to see where your Facebook friends have checked in, budget your stay (e.g. how much to spend per day), rate the places you have visited, and add photos from your trip. If you're traveling between two cities, suggest methods of transportation, etc. Perhaps connect with hotels and airlines to book your tickets at the cheapest price.
